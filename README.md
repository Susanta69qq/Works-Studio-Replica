The project has all the essential animations and effects as in the original site of "Works Studio". Libraries required for the execution of this project are Gsap, Locomotive JS, Locomotive CSS, ScrollTrigger JS, and others.
You are required to import all the necessary cdn's, for which steps are freely available on the internet. This project is a perfect blend of smooth UI experience and animations. Feel free to 
throw in your suggestions!!!! Only the repetitive part of this project has been left out, so any user can build the entire website from the existing code in this project. âœŒ
